# Portfolio
Showcasing some of the work that I have done in the field of Machine Learning and Data Science.

## Machine Learning
- ### Classification
  - __[Diagnosing X-rays](https://github.com/Mithul-Joseph/Pathology-Detection)__: Detection of pathology in chest X-rays using DenseNet and localization of the model using GradCAMs.
  - __[Loan data prediction](https://github.com/Mithul-Joseph/Portfolio/blob/main/Classification.ipynb)__: Classifying and predicting if the borrower pays back the loan using SVM and Random Forest. This project addresses the issue of class imbalance using SMOTE.
  - __[Real time object detection](https://github.com/Mithul-Joseph/Object_Detection.github.io)__: Detect multiple objects simultaneously in real-time by using your browser.
- ### Regression
  - __[Predicting housing prices](https://github.com/Mithul-Joseph/Portfolio/blob/main/Regression.ipynb )__: This model tries to predict the housing prices of a region using regression techniques like Linear Regression and how it is improved using Random Forest regressor.

## Natural Language Processing
- __[Chatbot](https://github.com/Mithul-Joseph/Chatbot)__: Developed a conversational chatbot using OpenAI's GPT3.
